 **_This module is to be used for Educational purposes only. Exploiting (Hacking) a computer without the concent of the owner is a criminal
offence purnishable by LAW_**

This is a simple script used during the post-exploitation phase of a penetartion test. This script was written in python 
using the [Geany Python Editor](https://www.geany.org/) This script comes in handy during the post-exploitation phase 
of a penetration test to gathere neccesary info on the target system. The script works on a windows operating system.

### To use this simple script:
- clone this repo to your local system.
- Download [Geany](https://www.geany.org/Download/Releases) if you dont already have one installed.
- Run the server first and then run the client script.

##### Note:
- The server uses local host on port 12345
- The script can only gather infromation on a compromised windows operatiing system.
- If the compromised system doesnt have a python interpreter u can uses **_TFTP_** to send the interpreter to
the compromised system. _(you need to check first if the compromised system allows UDP to pass throuhg its firewall 
and if TFTP is allowed on the network)_.
